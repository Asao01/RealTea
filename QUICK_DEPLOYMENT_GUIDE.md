## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Functions deployment fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check you're logged in
firebase login

# Verify project
firebase use --add

# Try again
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Issue: Backfill returns 404

**Wait:** Functions need 1-2 minutes to be fully available after deployment.

**Check URL:** Get correct URL from:
```bash
firebase functions:list
```

### Issue: Frontend build fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear cache
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Issue: Events missing shortSummary

**Solution:**
Run backfill again - it will create new events with shortSummary:
```bash
curl "https://[region]-[project].cloudfunctions.net/backfillHistory?month=10&day=18&max=10"
```

### Issue: Modal not opening

**Check:** Browser console for errors  
**Verify:** TimelineEvent.js was deployed  
**Test:** Clear browser cache and reload

---

## 📊 Monitoring (Optional)

### Firebase Console

1. **Functions Logs**
   - Firebase Console → Functions → Logs
   - Check scheduler runs daily at 1 AM
   - Verify no errors

2. **Firestore Usage**
   - Firebase Console → Firestore → Usage
   - Monitor read/write counts
   - Check storage size

3. **OpenAI Costs**
   - OpenAI Dashboard → Usage
   - Track API calls
   - Monitor monthly spend (~$10-15)

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### ✅ Deployment Successful If:

1. Firebase Functions deployed (3 functions visible)
2. Backfill creates events in Firestore
3. Events have shortSummary field
4. Frontend builds without errors
5. Live site shows digest summaries
6. Modal opens with full details
7. Sources are clickable
8. No console errors
