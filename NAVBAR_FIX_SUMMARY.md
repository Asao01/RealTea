# Navbar Duplication Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application had duplicate navigation headers across pages, causing visual issues and confusing UX.

## Root Cause
- **StickyHeader** component was being imported and used in 4 individual page files
- **Navbar** component was already included globally in `src/app/layout.js`
- This caused two headers to appear on certain pages

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Removed Duplicate Headers
Removed `StickyHeader` imports and usage from:
- `src/app/event/[id]/page.js`
- `src/app/transparency/page.js`
- `src/app/admin/page.js`
- `src/app/admin/diagnostics/page.js`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Navbar Component (`src/components/Navbar.js`)
**Visual Improvements:**
- Changed text color from `text-gray-700` to `text-gray-300` for better visibility on dark background
- Applied to both desktop and mobile menu items

**Positioning & Layout:**
- Kept `fixed top-0` position for consistent header placement
- Added `backdrop-blur-sm` for modern glass effect
- Changed background to `bg-gray-900/95` for semi-transparency

**Z-Index Fix:**
- Mobile dropdown menu now has `absolute top-full left-0 right-0 z-50`
- Added `shadow-2xl` for better depth perception
- Ensures dropdown appears above all other content

### 3. ✅ Layout Configuration (`src/app/layout.js`)
**Already Correct:**
- Navbar is included globally in the layout
- Main content has `pt-20` (padding-top: 5rem) to account for fixed navbar
- Proper provider nesting: ThemeProvider > PerformanceProvider > AuthProvider
