# ðŸš€ RealTea Quick Start - Firebase AI Functions

## 1. Set OpenAI API Key (1 minute)

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\Works\realtea-timeline\functions
echo OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here > .env
```

Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

## 2. Deploy Functions (2-3 minutes)

```bash
cd C:\Users\User\Desktop\Works\realtea-timeline
firebase deploy --only functions
```

Wait for deployment to complete. You'll see:
```
âœ”  functions: Finished running predeploy script.
âœ”  functions[scheduledDailyUpdate]: Successful create operation.
âœ”  functions[backfillHistory]: Successful create operation.
âœ”  functions[healthCheck]: Successful create operation.
```

## 3. Test Health Endpoint (30 seconds)

```bash
curl https://us-central1-reality-3af7f.cloudfunctions.net/healthCheck
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "firestore": "connected",
  "openai": "configured"
}
```

## 4. Populate Events (2-3 minutes)

```bash
# Test with today's date
curl "https://us-central1-reality-3af7f.cloudfunctions.net/backfillHistory"

# Or specific date
curl "https://us-central1-reality-3af7f.cloudfunctions.net/backfillHistory?month=10&day=18&max=50"
```

## 5. Verify in Firebase Console (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/reality-3af7f/firestore
2. Open `events` collection
3. Click any event
4. Confirm these fields exist:
   - background âœ“
   - keyFigures âœ“
   - causes âœ“
   - outcomes âœ“
   - impact âœ“
