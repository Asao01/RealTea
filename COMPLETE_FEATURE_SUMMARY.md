## 💰 Cost Analysis

### **Monthly Operating Costs**

| Service | Usage | Cost |
|---------|-------|------|
| **OpenAI API** | 200 events/day × 700 tokens | $10-15 |
| **Firebase Functions** | Daily cron + triggers | $0 (free tier) |
| **Firestore** | 6,000 writes/month | $0 (free tier) |
| **Vercel** | Hosting + functions | $0 (hobby tier) |
| **Total** | | **$10-15/month** |

**Break Down:**
- Enriched data generation: 600 tokens × $0.0015 = $0.30/day
- Short summary generation: 100 tokens × $0.0002 = $0.04/day
- **Total per day:** ~$0.34 × 30 = **~$10/month**
