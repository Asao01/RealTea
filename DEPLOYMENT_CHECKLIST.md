## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd realtea-timeline

# Install root dependencies
npm install

# Install Firebase Functions dependencies
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] No installation errors
- [ ] `node_modules` folder exists in both root and `functions/`

---

### Step 2: Configure Firebase

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize project (if not already done)
firebase init

# Select:
# - Functions (JavaScript)
# - Firestore
# - Hosting (optional)
```

**Set OpenAI API Key:**
```bash
firebase functions:config:set openai.key="sk-your-openai-key"
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Firebase project linked
- [ ] OpenAI key configured
- [ ] `firebase.json` exists

---

### Step 3: Deploy Firebase Functions

```bash
cd functions
npm run build  # If using TypeScript
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✔  functions: Finished running predeploy script.
✔  functions[scheduledDailyUpdate(us-central1)]: Successful update operation.
✔  functions[backfillHistory(us-central1)]: Successful update operation.
✔  functions[healthCheck(us-central1)]: Successful update operation.

✔  Deploy complete!
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] All three functions deployed
- [ ] No deployment errors
- [ ] Functions visible in Firebase Console

---

### Step 4: Test Firebase Function

```bash
# Test health check
curl https://[region]-[project].cloudfunctions.net/healthCheck

# Expected response:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "firestore": "connected",
#   "openai": "configured",
#   "timestamp": "2025-10-17T..."
# }

# Test backfill (generates one day of events)
curl https://[region]-[project].cloudfunctions.net/backfillHistory?month=10&day=17
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Health check returns "healthy"
- [ ] Backfill function executes without errors
- [ ] Check Firestore for new events with enriched fields

---

### Step 5: Verify Firestore Data

Open Firebase Console → Firestore Database → `events` collection

**Check for new fields in documents:**
- [ ] `background` field exists (string)
- [ ] `keyFigures` field exists (array)
- [ ] `causes` field exists (string)
- [ ] `outcomes` field exists (string)
- [ ] `impact` field exists (string)
- [ ] `sources` field exists (array)

**Example Document:**
```javascript
{
  title: "Apollo 11 Moon Landing",
  summary: "Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...",
  background: "The Apollo program was initiated...",
  keyFigures: ["Neil Armstrong", "Buzz Aldrin", ...],
  causes: "Cold War space race...",
  outcomes: "First successful landing...",
  impact: "Transformed space exploration...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

---

### Step 6: Deploy Frontend

```bash
cd realtea-timeline

# Build Next.js app
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Verify:**
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Production URL accessible

---

### Step 7: Test Frontend Display

Visit your deployed site and navigate to `/timeline`:

**Visual Tests:**
- [ ] Events display in dark theme (gray-900 background)
- [ ] Cards have rounded corners and shadows
- [ ] "Read more" button appears on each event
- [ ] Clicking "Read more" expands smoothly
- [ ] Enriched sections appear with icons
- [ ] Background section displays
- [ ] Key Figures displays as bullet list
- [ ] Causes section displays
- [ ] Outcomes section displays
- [ ] Impact section displays
- [ ] Sources are clickable links
- [ ] "Show less" button collapses smoothly

**Animation Tests:**
- [ ] Expand animation is smooth (no jank)
- [ ] Sections appear with stagger effect
- [ ] Hover effects work on cards
- [ ] Button interactions feel responsive

**Responsive Tests:**
- [ ] Mobile view (< 640px): Full width, vertical stacking
- [ ] Tablet view (640-1024px): Comfortable reading width
- [ ] Desktop view (> 1024px): Max width with good spacing

---

### Step 8: Browser Compatibility Test

Test on multiple browsers:

- [ ] **Chrome** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- [ ] **Firefox** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- [ ] **Safari** (Mac/iOS)
- [ ] **Edge** (Windows)
- [ ] **Mobile Safari** (iOS)
- [ ] **Chrome Mobile** (Android)

**Check for:**
- Consistent styling
- Smooth animations
- No console errors
- All features functional

---

### Step 9: Performance Verification

Open DevTools → Performance/Network:

- [ ] **Lighthouse Score** > 90 (Performance)
- [ ] **First Contentful Paint** < 2s
- [ ] **Time to Interactive** < 3s
- [ ] **No layout shifts** during expand/collapse
- [ ] **Smooth 60fps** animations

**Optimization Tips:**
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build -- --analyze

# Check for unused dependencies
npx depcheck
```

---

### Step 10: Monitor & Maintain

**Set up monitoring:**

1. **Firebase Console:**
   - [ ] Functions logs show no errors
   - [ ] Firestore queries are efficient
   - [ ] No rate limiting issues

2. **OpenAI Dashboard:**
   - [ ] API usage within budget
   - [ ] No quota exceeded errors
   - [ ] Response times acceptable

3. **Vercel Analytics:**
   - [ ] Page load times acceptable
   - [ ] No build failures
   - [ ] Error rate near zero

**Schedule regular checks:**
- [ ] Weekly: Review function logs
- [ ] Monthly: Check OpenAI costs
- [ ] Quarterly: Update dependencies

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: OpenAI API quota exceeded

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check usage at platform.openai.com
# Add payment method
# Or reduce batch size in config:
# CONFIG.MAX_EVENTS_PER_RUN = 100
```

### Issue: Firestore writes failing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Firestore rules
# Verify authentication
# Check quotas in Firebase Console
```

### Issue: Animations janky/slow

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Reduce transition duration
transition={{ duration: 0.2 }} // instead of 0.3

// Remove stagger delays
// transition={{ duration: 0.3 }} // no delay
```

### Issue: Enriched fields not showing

**Solution:**
1. Check Firestore documents have new fields
2. Verify conditional rendering logic
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Ensure data is not undefined/null
